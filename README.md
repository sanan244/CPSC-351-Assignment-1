# CPSC-351-Assignment-1
This program takes in user input and producer.cpp will send the input to shared memory. Then consumer.cpp will process the iput and make scheduling calculations based on the arrival time and run time the user provided. The output will display any interupts and also the turn around time.
Consumer.cpp and producer.cpp will be compiled and run separately as shown in the assignment examples.
